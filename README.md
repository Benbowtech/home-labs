# Home Lab

This repo is a work-in-progress log of my home lab setup. I'm using it to learn and build confidence in system admin tasks, network basics, and general IT support skills outside of a formal job.

### What I’m running

- **VirtualBox** for my virtual machines
- A **Windows 10** VM for admin and support practice
- A **Kali Linux** VM to explore basic tools and networking
- Host system: Windows 11

### Things I’m working on

- Setting up user accounts and managing permissions
- Applying updates and patches manually
- Learning how to configure basic firewall and system settings
- Testing network setups and troubleshooting connection issues
- Practicing secure backup and file recovery methods

### Why I’m doing this

I’ve worked in support roles before, but I wanted something hands-on at home where I could go deeper. This lab gives me space to break things, fix them, and keep learning. I’m aiming to build the skills I need for junior sysadmin roles or more technical support positions.
