Setting up Windows Sever 2022 and Active Directory 

This home-lab project is part of my IT skills development and get hands-on with Windows Server and Active Directory. In this example was to set up a Windows Server 2022 and AD creating Organizational Units (OUs) and users.
I built this entirely in VirtualBox using evaluation ISO images from Microsoft.

## The Set Up

I created a new VM in Virtualbox installed Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) so I could work with the GUI tools. The virtual disk was set to 50GB, dynamically allocated, and the VM was given 4GB RAM.

## Installed Active Directory Domain Services
From Server Manager I added the AD DS role and promoted the server to a domain controller.

## Created Organizational Units
Using Active Directory Users and Computers, I created a few OUs to simulate a basic company structure in lab.local these include HR,IT and Sales.

## Created New Users
I added sample users to each OU. For example: Hanna Frank in HR and David Brown in Sales. All new users in IT with password policies enforced

I wanted a real environment to practice: Setting up a domain from scratch, Learning how AD DS works in practice, Managing users, OUs, and password policies, Preparing for more advanced labs with GPOs, DNS, file shares, and domain joins

Iâ€™ll keep building on this by introducing a Windows 10 VM, joining it to the domain, and playing around with Group Policy Objects.

Tools Used

Oracle VirtualBox
Windows Server 2022 Evaluation ISO
Active Directory Users and Computers
Server Manager
